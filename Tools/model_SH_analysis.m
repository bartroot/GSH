function [V] = model_SH_analysis(Model)
% 
% This function constructs the coefficients of the given model
%
% input: - Model structure (defined by inputModel.m)
%
% output: - V, SH coefficients of the complete model
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Uses following functions:
%
%   - import_layer.m
%       - gmt2matrix.m
%   - layer_SH_analysis.m
%       - GSHA.m
%       - cs2sc.m
%       - sc2vecml.m
%       - geocradius.m (But this is an inert MATLAB function: aero toolbox)
